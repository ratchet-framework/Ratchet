# North Star

**Pawl becomes an agent that requires less from Aaron each week while doing more right.
Ratchet becomes the standard framework for this class of agent.**

## What success looks like

Aaron opens Telegram in the morning. The briefing is already there — personalized to what's actually happening today. A service restarted overnight, got logged, prevention task is already closed. Mission Control shows what shipped while he slept. He didn't have to ask for any of it.

Builders on other platforms run Ratchet agents of their own. The incident loop, memory architecture, and trust tiers are the standard way you build an agent that improves itself — the same way you'd reach for git for version control.

## The six epics

| # | Epic | Focus | Horizon |
|---|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Autonomy** | Trust tiers, backlog execution, proactive work | Q2 2026 |
| 2 | **Intelligence** | Calendar/email integration, pattern detection, anticipation | Q2 2026 |
| 3 | **Mission Control** | Dashboard, visibility, self-documentation | Q1 2026 |

## Operating rhythm

| Cadence | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| **Continuous** | Pawl executes against BACKLOG.md via heartbeat |
| **Weekly** | Friday review: metrics, trust tier check, one Growth action |
| **Monthly** | Milestone check: epic progress, proposed focus for next month |
| **Quarterly** | North Star review: is the direction still right? |

## How we track progress

- **GitHub Issues** — individual tasks, tagged to epics via Milestones
- **BACKLOG.md** — Pawl's autonomous work queue
- **metrics.json** — weekly measurements (incidents, backlog velocity, adoption)
- **trust.json** — autonomy tier, evidence, advancement criteria
- **CURRENT.md** — what's in-flight right now

The metrics accumulate. The trust tier advances. The ratchet clicks forward.
